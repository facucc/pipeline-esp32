# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
#example
name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    paths:
      - 'src/*'
      - 'include/*'
      - 'test/*'
  #pull_request:
  #  branches: [ "main" ]
